# Digital Valentine Card for my Angie ❤️

## Inspirations found in Internet

* Scroll snap with Intersection Observer from [Sebelas Level](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=0Fn30rKEbxc), [demo from Roee Yossef](https://codepen.io/roeey/pen/YzqpMbR)
* Section transitions smoothed with gradients inspired by [CSS Gradient](https://cssgradient.io/gradient-backgrounds/)
* [highlight text with scroll down](https://frontendmasters.com/blog/highlight-text-when-a-user-scrolls-down-to-that-piece-of-text/)

## Technologies

* Simple and solid stuff: Vanilla JS inlined into HTML file with CSS with BEM

## Setup

* Very simple site, used [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) for running local developer's environment, Github with [Netlify](https://docs.netlify.com/) for deployment
